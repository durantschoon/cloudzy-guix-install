# Raspberry Pi Installation Scripts

## Apple Silicon Required

‚ö†Ô∏è **This platform requires an Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3/M4) to build Raspberry Pi images.**

Unlike other platforms (cloudzy, framework), Raspberry Pi installation uses a different approach:

### Build on Apple Silicon Mac ‚Üí Flash to SD Card ‚Üí Boot on Pi

**Why this approach:**

- Apple Silicon Macs are ARM64 (aarch64) machines - same architecture as Raspberry Pi
- Native compilation without cross-compilation or emulation
- Fast build times (30-60 minutes on M1/M2)
- Proven workflow tested on M-series Macs

### Technical Constraints

#### 1. Manual Firmware Dependency

- Raspberry Pi requires proprietary firmware files (start4.elf, fixup4.dat, etc.)
- Cannot be distributed with Guix due to licensing
- Must be manually downloaded from Raspberry Pi firmware repository
- Firmware added to boot partition after image generation

#### 2. Image-Based Installation

- Raspberry Pi requires pre-built SD card image
- Image built on Mac, then written to SD card
- Different from VPS/laptop where we run installer from live ISO
- Boot process: GPU firmware ‚Üí U-Boot ‚Üí GRUB ‚Üí Guix kernel

#### 3. Why Not Fully Automated?

- Cannot automate firmware download (licensing restrictions)
- Requires Apple Silicon Mac for native ARM64 builds
- Image must be built off-device, then flashed
- Manual firmware addition step cannot be avoided

## What We Provide

Complete documentation for building Raspberry Pi images on Apple Silicon:

### ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step Guide**

- Install Guix on your Apple Silicon Mac
- Build Raspberry Pi image natively (no emulation)
- Add firmware files to image
- Flash to SD card using `dd` or Balena Etcher
- Boot on Raspberry Pi 4

### ‚úÖ **Post-Installation Customization**

- `raspberry-pi/postinstall/customize` - Interactive menu
- Access to shared recipes (Spacemacs, dev tools, fonts)
- Pi-specific tips (lightweight desktops, etc.)

### ‚úÖ **Configuration Templates**

- Based on Guix's official `raspberry-pi-64.tmpl`
- Minimal working configuration
- U-Boot bootloader setup
- Correct file system layout

### ‚úÖ **macOS-Specific Commands**

- `hdiutil` for mounting images
- `diskutil` for SD card management
- Native `dd` for flashing
- Tested on M1, M2, and M3 Macs

## Installation Workflow

On your Apple Silicon Mac:

```text
1. Install Guix on Mac
   ‚Üì
2. Build Raspberry Pi image (native ARM64 compilation)
   ‚Üì
3. Download Raspberry Pi firmware from GitHub
   ‚Üì
4. Mount image and add firmware to boot partition
   ‚Üì
5. Flash image to SD card
   ‚Üì
6. Insert SD card into Raspberry Pi and boot
   ‚Üì
7. Run post-installation customization on Pi
```

**Steps 1-5: On your Mac**
**Steps 6-7: On the Raspberry Pi**

## Future Automation Possibilities

**What could be scripted:**

1. **Mac setup script**
   - Install Guix on macOS
   - Verify Apple Silicon architecture
   - Download firmware repository

2. **Image build script**
   - Automate `guix system image` command
   - Mount image automatically
   - Copy firmware files
   - Unmount image

3. **SD card flash script**
   - Detect SD card automatically
   - Safety checks before flashing
   - Progress indication

**What cannot be automated:**

- Firmware distribution (licensing)
- Requiring physical SD card insertion
- Raspberry Pi first boot

### Current approach: Well-documented manual process

- Clear step-by-step instructions
- macOS-specific commands (`hdiutil`, `diskutil`)
- Works reliably on Apple Silicon
- Tested on M1/M2/M3 Macs

## If You Want to Contribute

**Helpful contributions:**

1. Test builds on different Apple Silicon models (M1/M2/M3/M4)
2. Create automation scripts for Mac workflow
3. Document working configurations
4. Test different Raspberry Pi models (3B+, Zero 2 W, etc.)
5. Write Pi-specific recipes (GPIO, camera, etc.)

**What would be valuable:**

1. macOS setup automation script
2. Image build + firmware integration script
3. SD card detection and flashing script
4. More configuration templates

This README explains:

- ‚úÖ Why automation isn't possible
- ‚úÖ What manual steps are required
- ‚úÖ How to work within these limitations

We believe honest documentation is better than scripts that fail mysteriously.
