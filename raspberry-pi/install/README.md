# Raspberry Pi Installation Scripts

## Why No Automated Scripts?

Unlike other platforms (cloudzy, framework), Raspberry Pi installation **cannot be fully automated** for several technical reasons:

### 1. **aarch64 Build Requirement**

- Guix images must be built on an aarch64 machine (or cross-compiled)
- Most users run x86_64 systems
- Would require Qemu emulation or remote build server
- Can't assume user has access to aarch64 build environment

### 2. **Manual Firmware Dependency**

- Raspberry Pi requires proprietary firmware files (start4.elf, fixup4.dat, etc.)
- These files are not included in Guix
- Must be manually downloaded from Raspberry Pi firmware repository
- Cannot be automatically fetched due to licensing/distribution concerns
- Firmware must be added to boot partition **after** image generation

### 3. **Boot Process Complexity**

- Raspberry Pi boot: GPU firmware â†’ U-Boot â†’ GRUB â†’ Guix kernel
- config.txt must be manually configured
- U-Boot binary must be correctly named (u-boot.bin)
- Partitioning differs from standard PC (FAT32 boot + ext4 root)
- Cannot run installation scripts FROM Raspberry Pi (chicken-and-egg problem)

### 4. **Image-Based Installation**

- Raspberry Pi requires pre-built SD card image
- Image is built **off-device** then written to SD card
- Can't run interactive installer on the Pi itself during first boot
- Different from VPS/laptop where we can run installer from live ISO

### 5. **Testing Limitations**

- Limited aarch64 CI/CD infrastructure
- Smaller community testing than x86_64
- Hardware-specific issues (SD card compatibility, power, heat)
- Can't guarantee scripts work across all Pi configurations

## What We Provide Instead

Since full automation isn't possible, we provide:

### âœ… **Comprehensive Documentation**

- `raspberry-pi/README.md` - Complete setup guide
- Step-by-step firmware installation
- Config examples (raspberry-pi-minimal.scm)
- Troubleshooting guide

### âœ… **Post-Installation Customization**

- `raspberry-pi/postinstall/customize` - Interactive menu
- Access to shared recipes (Spacemacs, dev tools, fonts)
- Pi-specific tips (lightweight desktops, etc.)

### âœ… **Configuration Template**

Based on Guix's official `raspberry-pi-64.tmpl`:

- Minimal working configuration
- U-Boot bootloader setup
- Correct file system layout

### âœ… **Clear Instructions**

- Method 1: Build on aarch64 machine (recommended)
- Method 2: Use Qemu/UTM VM
- Firmware download and installation
- SD card flashing

## Installation Workflow

Instead of automated scripts:

```text
1. Build environment (aarch64 machine or VM)
   â†“
2. Build Guix image using template
   â†“
3. Download Raspberry Pi firmware
   â†“
4. Add firmware to image boot partition
   â†“
5. Flash image to SD card
   â†“
6. Boot Raspberry Pi
   â†“
7. Run post-installation customization
```

**Automation starts at step 7** (after successful boot)

## Could This Be Improved?

**Possible future automation:**

1. **Pre-built images** (with firmware included)
   - Legal/licensing complexity
   - Storage/bandwidth requirements
   - Need to maintain multiple Pi versions

2. **Firmware download script**
   - Could automate firmware fetch
   - Still requires manual partition mounting
   - Helpful but doesn't solve main issues

3. **Cross-compilation support**
   - Allow building aarch64 from x86_64
   - Slow and complex
   - Guix substitutes are better solution

4. **Hosted build service**
   - Users upload config, get image
   - Requires infrastructure
   - Security/trust concerns

### Current approach: Manual but well-documented

- Realistic about limitations
- Acknowledges complexity
- Provides clear guidance
- Works reliably when followed

## If You Want to Contribute

**Helpful contributions:**

1. Test builds on different aarch64 platforms
2. Document working configurations
3. Create more config.scm examples
4. Test different Raspberry Pi models (3B+, Zero 2 W, etc.)
5. Write Pi-specific recipes (GPIO, camera, etc.)

**Not currently feasible:**

1. Fully automated installer scripts
2. Self-contained installation process
3. x86_64 â†’ aarch64 automated cross-compilation

For complete installation instructions:
ðŸ‘‰ **`raspberry-pi/README.md`**

This README explains:

- âœ… Why automation isn't possible
- âœ… What manual steps are required
- âœ… How to work within these limitations

We believe honest documentation is better than scripts that fail mysteriously.
