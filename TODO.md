# TODO

1. We're about to use labelling, etc. I should pre-label my framework13 with all caps and also shrink pop os to 60Gb and grow guix os to 100Gb since guix will be my primary os
2. after framework-dual is approved that it's working by the user, update the other platforms to use go. Refer to each script in framework-dual, to keep all the hardwon improvements.
3. when the go version is confirmed to work, push a new major version tag and update the default tag in the rrs.go script
