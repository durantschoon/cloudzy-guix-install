# TODO

1. When the go version is confirmed to work, push a new major version tag and update the default tag in the rrs.go script
   - Also test short urls for the cloudzy example. If that works, also publish a version of that and make short urls that contain the version.
2. Move knowledge from debugging.md to installation_knowledge.md
