# TODO

1. Before the go version is confirmed to work
   - Clean up
     - scripts from main dir (see checklist)
     - .md files like network manager test plan, etc.
2. When the go version is confirmed to work, push a new major version tag and update the default tag in the rrs.go script
   - Also test short urls for the cloudzy example. If that works, also publish a version of that and make short urls that contain the version.
3. Update tests (based on what is most critical and make sure we're utilizing the docker containers for testing to the best of our abilities)
