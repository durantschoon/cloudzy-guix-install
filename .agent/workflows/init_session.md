description: Initialize a new development session by loading context and status.
---

1. Read `CHECKLIST.md` to understand the overall project status, "Currently Working On" items, and recent completions.
2. List the `docs/dev/` directory and read the **latest** `WORKLOG` markdown file (e.g., `docs/dev/2026-01-WORKLOG.md`) to get the immediate context, failed commands, or decisions from the previous session.
3. Append a new entry to the `WORKLOG` with the header **"SESSION START: [Timestamp]"**.
4. Check `task.md` (if it exists) to see if there are any stale tasks, but prioritize the state found in `CHECKLIST.md` and the `WORKLOG`.
5. Summarize the current project status to the user and ask for the immediate objective.
