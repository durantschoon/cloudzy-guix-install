# Development Notes for Claude Code

This document contains important notes for AI assistants (like Claude Code) working on this repository.

## Expected behavior when updating the code

- Do not remove code without being told explicitly to do so.
- It is fin and encouraged to flag code that you think should be removed and let the user decide after your updates to a section of code.
- Each line/block/unit of code should have at least one purpose (goal it is trying to achieve) and if you need to, create a file ending in `codefilename_purpose.txt` which follows the flow of the code, module by module, function by function, variable by variable etc. which states the justification the section. For example include reasoning why a certain setting is kept in the bare minimal config.scm file. You can also leave notes in the right areas of the text file to mention statements of omission, for example "although you might be tempted to include setting X, we leave it out because it causes problem Y" (the more specific the better, for example, in version ABC of guix).

## Important Constraints

### Guix ISO Terminal Limitations

**DO NOT use Unicode characters in scripts that run on the Guix ISO.**

The Guix ISO terminal has limited Unicode support and will display broken characters for:

- Checkmarks: ‚úì ‚úÖ ‚ùå
- Emojis: üöÄ üíª ü•ß ‚ö° etc.
- Special symbols: ‚ö†Ô∏è üõ°Ô∏è etc.

**Affected files:**

- `bootstrap-installer.sh` - Runs on Guix ISO
- `run-remote-steps.go` - Runs on Guix ISO (compiled and executed during install)
- Any `**/install/*.sh` or `**/install/*.go` files

**Use instead:**

- `[OK]` instead of ‚úì
- `[ERROR]` instead of ‚ùå
- `[WARN]` or `WARNING:` instead of ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Plain text descriptions

**OK to use Unicode:**

- README.md and other documentation (viewed in browsers/editors)
- `**/postinstall/**` scripts (run after booting into installed Guix system)
- Scripts run on modern terminals outside the ISO

## Code Patterns

### Reading User Input

Always read from `/dev/tty` instead of stdin when prompting for user input:

**Bash:**

```bash
read -p "Continue? [Y/n] " -r </dev/tty
```

**Go:**

```go
tty, err := os.Open("/dev/tty")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
defer tty.Close()
reader := bufio.NewReader(tty)
answer, err := reader.ReadString('\n')
```

**Why:** stdin may be redirected by process substitution, pipes, or other operations. `/dev/tty` always points to the actual terminal.

### Process Substitution for File Reading

When reading files in loops, use process substitution to avoid consuming stdin:

**Correct:**

```bash
while IFS= read -r line; do
    # process line
done < <(cat SOURCE_MANIFEST.txt)
```

**Incorrect (breaks stdin for later reads):**

```bash
while IFS= read -r line; do
    # process line
done < SOURCE_MANIFEST.txt
```

## Architecture

### Installation Flow

1. User downloads `bootstrap-installer.sh` from GitHub
2. Bootstrap script:
   - Downloads repository tarball
   - Verifies checksums against `SOURCE_MANIFEST.txt`
   - Asks user to verify manifest hash
   - Builds `run-remote-steps` from Go source
   - Runs the compiled installer
3. Go installer (`run-remote-steps.go`):
   - Prompts before each step
   - Runs installation steps in sequence
   - Uses shared State struct for configuration

### State Management

All installation state is managed through a shared `State` struct (in `framework-dual/install/state.go`):

- No bash variable passing between scripts
- Type-safe, centralized configuration
- Passed as pointer to each step

### Verification Strategy

1. `SOURCE_MANIFEST.txt` contains SHA256 checksums of all source files
2. Bootstrap verifies downloaded files match manifest
3. User manually verifies manifest hash matches documentation
4. Go modules provide additional verification (go.mod/go.sum)

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Don't use Unicode in ISO scripts** - See above
2. **Don't read from os.Stdin directly** - Use /dev/tty
3. **Don't use `done < file.txt`** - Use process substitution
4. **Don't add timestamps to manifest** - Makes hash unstable
5. **Don't use `exec` in bootstrap** - Breaks stdin for Go installer
6. **Don't commit without running tests** - Always run `./run-tests.sh` first
7. **Don't commit without updating manifest** - See below
8. **Don't add new code without tests** - All new functions need corresponding tests
9. **Don't refactor without integration tests** - Verify functionality after moving code

## Development Workflow

### Testing After Code Changes

**CRITICAL:** After refactoring or modifying code, you **MUST** run tests and fix any issues before committing:

```bash
# Run all tests to verify changes work correctly
./run-tests.sh

# If tests fail, fix the code and re-run tests
# Only proceed to commit after all tests pass
```

**Test Coverage Requirements:**

- **New functions** must have corresponding unit tests in `lib/common_test.go`
- **Refactored code** must have integration tests to verify functionality
- **String operations** (like partition path generation) must be tested
- **Error handling** must be tested with invalid inputs
- **Function signatures** must be verified after refactoring

**Test Files:**

- `lib/common_test.go` - Unit tests for shared functions
- `framework-dual/install/*_test.go` - Integration tests for install steps
- `run-tests.sh` - Automated test runner

**Why Testing is Required:**

- Ensures refactored code works correctly
- Prevents regressions when moving functions to common library
- Verifies function signatures and accessibility
- Validates string operations and error handling
- Maintains code quality and reliability

### Before Committing Changes

If you modified any scripts that run on the Guix ISO, you **MUST** update the manifest before committing:

```bash
# 1. Run tests first (see above)
./run-tests.sh

# 2. Update manifest with new file checksums
./update-manifest.sh

# 3. Commit all changes including tests and manifest
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

**Files that require manifest update:**

- `bootstrap-installer.sh`
- `run-remote-steps.go`
- Any file in `**/install/*.go`
- Any file in `**/install/*.sh`
- Any new test files (`*_test.go`)

**Why:** The manifest contains SHA256 checksums of all source files. Users verify this manifest hash to ensure GitHub's CDN has the latest version. If you don't update it, users will get checksum mismatches when they try to install.

**The update-manifest.sh script:**

- Generates checksums for all Go source files and bootstrap script
- Writes them to `SOURCE_MANIFEST.txt`
- Displays the manifest hash for documentation/verification
- Only changes when actual source files change (no timestamp)

## Repository Conventions

### Factor Common Code into lib/common.go

When adding features that are needed in multiple installers (cloudzy, framework, framework-dual, raspberry-pi), extract reusable logic into `lib/common.go` rather than duplicating it. Examples:

- Label checks: use `VerifyLabelsExist(...)`
- Mount-by-label: use `MountByLabel(label, mountPoint)`
- Free-space checks: use `GetMountFreeSpaceGiB(path)`
- Command logging: enable once per step with `EnableCommandLogging("/tmp/guix-install.log")`

This keeps installers small, readable, and consistent.

### Add Tests for New Code

**MANDATORY:** When adding new functions or features, you **MUST** add corresponding tests:

**For new functions in `lib/common.go`:**

- Add unit tests in `lib/common_test.go`
- Test with various input combinations
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Test string operations (partition paths, device detection, etc.)

**For new install steps:**

- Add integration tests in `{platform}/install/*_test.go`
- Test function signatures and accessibility
- Test state management and persistence
- Test error handling and recovery

**Test Naming Convention:**

- Unit tests: `TestFunctionName`
- Integration tests: `TestStepName_Integration`
- Error tests: `TestFunctionName_ErrorHandling`

**Example test structure:**

```go
func TestMakePartitionPath(t *testing.T) {
    testCases := []struct {
        device   string
        partNum  string
        expected string
    }{
        {"/dev/nvme0n1", "1", "/dev/nvme0n1p1"},
        {"/dev/sda", "2", "/dev/sda2"},
        // ... more test cases
    }
    
    for _, tc := range testCases {
        t.Run(tc.device+"_"+tc.partNum, func(t *testing.T) {
            result := MakePartitionPath(tc.device, tc.partNum)
            if result != tc.expected {
                t.Errorf("got %s, want %s", result, tc.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

**Why tests are required:**

- Ensures new code works correctly
- Prevents regressions during refactoring
- Documents expected behavior
- Enables safe code changes
- Maintains code quality standards

### Update Documentation After Adding Features

After implementing user-visible behavior or flow changes, update the docs in the same commit:

- `CHECKLIST.md` statuses and guidance
- `README.md` and `QUICKSTART.md` usage notes
- Platform readmes under `framework*/README.md` or `raspberry-pi/**` where applicable

Docs should reflect new safety checks, logging, and any changed commands or defaults.

### Checklist-Driven Workflow

We work from `CHECKLIST.md` and track progress explicitly:

- Before starting a feature, review the relevant checklist items
- Implement changes, then immediately update `CHECKLIST.md` statuses
- Keep commits aligned with checklist items so changes are auditable
- If items spawn new sub-tasks, add them to the checklist and complete them before closing the parent

### Resolve Design Conflicts Early

If you encounter a potential conflict between existing code, documentation, or stated design goals:

- Do not guess; add a brief note in the commit or PR description
- Alert the user promptly to discuss the trade-offs and pick a direction
- Once resolved, update code and docs together to reflect the agreed design

## Reviewer Personas (Offer These at Milestones)

After a developer completes a milestone, offer to review changes by adopting one of these personas:

1. **Mid‚ÄëLevel Unix User New to Guix**
   - Focus: onboarding clarity, data‚Äëloss warnings, Secure Boot notes, first‚Äëboot expectations, networking quick path
   - Goal: ensure the Quickstart and README answer "what do I do next?" with minimal Guix background

2. **Seasoned Guix User**
   - Focus: channel pinning, substitute trust, receipts/provenance, services (NetworkManager, TLP, time sync, fstrim), storage options (LUKS/btrfs), diagnostics
   - Goal: robustness, reproducibility, and clean Guix idioms

3. **Dual‚ÄëBoot Laptop Owner**
   - Focus: GRUB visibility, chainloading Pop!_OS, keeping existing partitions safe, clear rollback paths
   - Goal: confidence that dual‚Äëboot stays usable and recoverable

How to offer: ‚ÄúDo you want a review as a [Mid‚ÄëLevel Unix User], [Seasoned Guix User], or [Dual‚ÄëBoot Laptop Owner]?‚Äù
