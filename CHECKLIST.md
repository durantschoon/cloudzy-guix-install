# Guix Installer Design Goals and Roadmap

The goal of this project is to create a **reliable, repeatable, and hardware-aware Guix OS installation flow** tailored to the Framework 13 laptop. The installer should maximize success on first boot while remaining portable and adaptable for other systems.

---

## üß≠ Core Design Principles

### 1. Start From a Super-Minimal `config.scm`

We want the initial install configuration to be as small and deterministic as possible. That means:

* **Remove everything non-essential** from the base `config.scm`: no keyboard layout, no user comment field, no desktop environment, no CUPS, etc.
* Keep only:
  * `host-name`
  * `locale` and `timezone`
  * `bootloader` section
  * Essential `file-systems`
  * `users` block (with password set before reboot ‚Äî see below)

**Goal:** This stage should do *one thing only* ‚Äî reliably install a bootable Guix system shell.

Later stages (like adding services, desktop environments, etc.) will happen via a `guix system reconfigure` using a richer configuration file.

---

### 2. Verify Kernel and Initrd Before Reboot

One of the most common failure modes is rebooting into a system without a kernel or initrd present. To prevent this:

* Add a **post-`system init` verification step** to the scripts.
* The script should check that the following files exist before offering to reboot:

```bash
ls /mnt/boot/vmlinuz* /mnt/boot/initrd* >/dev/null
ls /mnt/boot/efi/EFI/guix/grubx64.efi >/dev/null
```

* If any of these are missing, the script should print a clear error and refuse to reboot until the issue is fixed.
* This verification step is simple but essential for catching broken installs early.

**Status:** ‚ùå Not implemented

---

### 3. Pre-Set the User Password Before First Boot

To avoid the frustrating "can't log in" situation:

* After `guix system init` succeeds but **before reboot**, `chroot` into the installed system and run `passwd` for the primary user.
* This will guarantee that the first boot lands on a login screen you can actually enter.

This approach is preferred over embedding a password hash directly in the config, because it avoids storing secrets in version control.

**Status:** ‚ùå Not implemented

---

### 4. Eliminate "Nomodeset" Workarounds With Hardware-Aware Defaults

Currently, first boots sometimes require pressing `e` in GRUB and adding `nomodeset` to work around AMD GPU issues. This is fragile and confusing for users. To solve this:

* In the **Framework-specific scripts/config**, include the absolute minimum required to boot cleanly without manual GRUB editing:
  * Add the `amdgpu`, `nvme`, `xhci_pci`, `usbhid`, and `i2c_piix4` modules to `initrd`.
  * Include `(kernel linux)` and `(firmware (list linux-firmware))` (requires `nonguix` channel).
  * Set kernel arguments to something stable like `("quiet" "loglevel=3")`.

This makes the Framework variant slightly more opinionated but much more user-friendly ‚Äî the system should "just boot" into a login prompt.

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially implemented (kernel/firmware added, initrd modules not yet specified)

---

## ‚úÖ What We're Doing Correctly

### 1. cow-store Usage
- ‚úÖ **Added `herd start cow-store /mnt` before `guix system init`**
- ‚úÖ Never using `mount --bind /mnt/gnu /gnu`

### 2. Partition Labeling
- ‚úÖ **Using uppercase labels: `GUIX_ROOT` and `EFI`**
- ‚úÖ Setting GPT partition names via `parted name`
- ‚úÖ Setting filesystem labels via `mkfs.ext4 -L` and `mkfs.vfat -n`

### 3. Installation Command
- ‚úÖ Using `--fallback` flag for local builds
- ‚úÖ Using multiple substitute URLs for redundancy
- ‚úÖ Retry logic (3 attempts with 10s delay)

### 4. Mount Order
- ‚úÖ Correct sequence: root first, then EFI at `/mnt/boot/efi`
- ‚úÖ Creating mount points before mounting

### 5. Storage Management
- ‚úÖ Setting `TMPDIR=/mnt/var/tmp` to use target disk
- ‚úÖ Setting `XDG_CACHE_HOME=/mnt/var/cache`
- ‚úÖ Clearing substitute cache

### 6. Safety Features
- ‚úÖ Checking for Guix live ISO environment
- ‚úÖ Idempotency checks (skip if already formatted)
- ‚úÖ User confirmation prompts for destructive operations

## üìã Implementation Gaps and Action Items

### High Priority (Do First)

#### 1. EFI Partition Verification (CRITICAL)
**Status:** ‚ùå Not implemented

**Missing checks:**
```bash
# Verify ESP is FAT32
df -T /mnt/boot/efi | grep -q vfat || { echo "ERROR: EFI not FAT32"; exit 1; }

# Verify mount is correct
mount | grep "/mnt/boot/efi"
```

**Why it matters:**
- Most common installation failure: "doesn't look like an EFI partition"
- Early detection prevents wasted installation time
- Provides clear error messages

**Impact:** High - Prevents cryptic errors during `guix system init`

---

#### 2. Post-Installation Verification (CRITICAL)
**Status:** ‚ùå Not implemented

**Missing checks after `guix system init`:**
```bash
# Verify kernel and initrd
ls /mnt/boot/vmlinuz-* || echo "ERROR: No kernel"
ls /mnt/boot/initrd-* || echo "ERROR: No initrd"

# Verify GRUB installation
ls /mnt/boot/grub/grub.cfg || echo "ERROR: No GRUB config"
ls /mnt/boot/efi/EFI/guix/grubx64.efi || echo "ERROR: No GRUB EFI"
ls /mnt/boot/efi/EFI/guix/grub.cfg || echo "ERROR: No GRUB EFI config"
```

**Why it matters:**
- Detects incomplete installations before reboot
- Prevents "no bootable device" scenarios
- Allows immediate retry while still in live environment

**Impact:** High - Prevents failed boot experiences

---

#### 3. Use Mount-by-Label in config.scm for EFI
**Status:** ‚ùå Not implemented

**Current:**
```scheme
(file-system
  (mount-point "/boot/efi")
  (device "/dev/nvme0n1p1")  ; Device path, not label!
  (type "vfat"))
```

**Should be:**
```scheme
(file-system
  (mount-point "/boot/efi")
  (device (file-system-label "EFI"))
  (type "vfat"))
```

**Why it matters:**
- Root already uses UUID (good!)
- EFI should use label for consistency
- Prevents boot issues if device enumeration changes

**Impact:** Medium - Can cause boot failures in some scenarios

---

### Medium Priority

#### 4. Mount by Label in Scripts
**Status:** ‚ùå Not implemented

**Current approach:**
```go
// We mount by device path
state.EFI = "/dev/nvme0n1p1"
state.Root = "/dev/nvme0n1p2"
```

**Should be:**
```go
// Mount by label for reliability
state.EFI = "/dev/disk/by-label/EFI"
state.Root = "/dev/disk/by-label/GUIX_ROOT"
```

**Why it matters:**
- Device paths can change between boots (especially with multiple disks)
- Labels are stable and don't depend on device enumeration order
- This is especially important for dual-boot scenarios

**Impact:** Medium-High - Can cause boot failures if device order changes

---

#### 5. Bootloader Timeout Configuration
**Status:** ‚ùå Not set

**Current:**
```scheme
(bootloader-configuration
  (bootloader grub-efi-bootloader)
  (targets '("/boot/efi"))
  (keyboard-layout (keyboard-layout "us")))
```

**Should include:**
```scheme
(bootloader-configuration
  (bootloader grub-efi-bootloader)
  (targets '("/boot/efi"))
  (timeout 5)  ; Show menu for 5 seconds
  (keyboard-layout (keyboard-layout "us")))
```

**Why it matters:**
- Default timeout is 0 (hidden menu) - users can't select OS in dual-boot
- Framework-dual needs visible menu to access Pop!_OS
- F12 firmware menu is a workaround, not a solution

**Impact:** Medium - Affects dual-boot usability

---

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

#### 6. Label Verification Commands
**Status:** ‚ùå Not shown to user

**Should display:**
```bash
# Show labels after formatting
echo "Verifying partition labels..."
e2label /dev/nvme0n1p2        # Should show: GUIX_ROOT
fatlabel /dev/nvme0n1p1       # Should show: EFI
parted /dev/nvme0n1 print     # Should show GPT names
```

**Why it matters:**
- Confirms labels are correctly set
- Helps users debug if something goes wrong
- Educational for users learning Guix

**Impact:** Low - Nice for debugging

---

#### 7. Free Space Verification
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Framework-dual only

**Missing for cloudzy and framework:**
```bash
# Check free space before installation
available=$(df -BG /mnt | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/G//')
[[ $available -lt 40 ]] && echo "WARNING: Less than 40GB free"
```

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents running out of space during installation
- Early warning for users

**Impact:** Low - Installation will fail anyway, but later

---

## üîß Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Critical Safety Checks (Do Now)
1. ‚úÖ Add pre-init EFI verification
2. ‚úÖ Add post-init file verification (kernel, initrd, GRUB)
3. ‚úÖ Use file-system-label for EFI in config
4. ‚úÖ Set user password via chroot before reboot

### Phase 2: Hardware-Aware Defaults (Next)
5. ‚úÖ Add Framework-specific initrd modules
6. ‚úÖ Add bootloader timeout for dual-boot
7. ‚úÖ Add label verification output

### Phase 3: Robustness Improvements (When Time Permits)
8. Switch to mount-by-label in mount scripts
9. Add free space checks to all installers
10. Optional: Generate fallback GRUB entry with `nomodeset`

## üìä Summary of Installation Stages

| Phase                                | Goal                                                  | Result                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Stage 1: Minimal Install**         | Tiny config, password pre-set, kernel/initrd verified | Always boots to a shell  |
| **Stage 2: Framework Profile**       | Add GPU firmware, essential modules, network, DE      | Boots without GRUB hacks |
| **Stage 3: Full System Reconfigure** | Add `/data` mounts, services, desktop, dotfiles, etc. | Complete environment     |

---

## üéØ Summary

**In short:** we want a *bulletproof base install*, automatic sanity checks, and hardware-aware defaults that make first boot smooth and predictable ‚Äî no typing `nomodeset`, no guessing at passwords, and no surprises when the reboot happens.

The current implementation is solid for single-boot VPS scenarios. The gaps mostly affect edge cases, dual-boot reliability, and first-boot user experience on Framework laptops.
