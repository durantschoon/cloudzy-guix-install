## ✅ Latest Completed Items

**Most Recent:**
1. ✅ **Installed System Now Inherits the Channel Pin (2026-08-02)**: The generated config mirrors the pinned guix+nonguix commit pair into the target via `guix-configuration`, so the guix service writes `/etc/guix/channels.scm` at activation. Found the hard way: `guix system reconfigure /etc/config.scm` **on the machine that config had just built** died with `no code for module (nongnu packages linux)` — `guix system init` copies the store closure, not the channels. The same override adds `https://substitutes.nonguix.org` to `substitute-urls` and its signing key to `authorized-keys`; authorizing the key without the URL does not error, it just silently compiles Linux from source. Guarded by `TestGenerateMinimalConfig_ChannelsAndSubstitutes`; recovery steps for an already-installed system in [docs/RECOVERY_REBUILD_FROM_HOST_OS.md](docs/RECOVERY_REBUILD_FROM_HOST_OS.md).
2. ✅ **Framework-dual Repin VERIFIED ON HARDWARE (2026-08-02)**: Rebuilt the Guix system from the Pop!_OS side (no ISO) onto `linux-7.1.5` + `linux-firmware-20260622`. Confirmed on first boot: **keyboard works**, WiFi connects via `nmtui`, `dmesg | grep -i amdgpu` clean. One root cause explained four symptoms — dead keyboard, no wireless driver, Bluetooth `wmt` timeouts, and amdgpu `error -2` — all a kernel/firmware set older than the machine. Added NetworkManager + wpa-supplicant + dbus + polkit + ntp to the generated config (`%base-services` is loopback-only, and this laptop has no ethernet port, so the old config could never reach a network), switched to `microcode-initrd`, and documented the whole route in [docs/RECOVERY_REBUILD_FROM_HOST_OS.md](docs/RECOVERY_REBUILD_FROM_HOST_OS.md).
3. ✅ **Framework-dual Repin + Kernel Arg Reversal (2026-08-01)**: Identified the laptop as **Ryzen AI 300** (Strix Point, GPU `1002:1114`) and the wingolog-era Feb-2024 channel pin as the *cause* of the amdgpu firmware failure it was meant to fix — that silicon shipped ~5 months after those commits. Repinned guix/nonguix to recent commits (`lib/common.go`), removed `nomodeset`/`noapic`/`nolapic`, fixed `(options "noatime")` → `(flags '(no-atime))`, and dropped the no-op initrd module filter. Regression tests added for all four. **Correction:** the removal of those kernel arguments was justified on its own merits, but the claim that they explained the dead keyboard was wrong — inspection of the deployed GRUB entry showed only `quiet` had ever been passed. They were a latent defect in the generator, never deployed.
4. ✅ **Log Serving Tool (2026-01-01)**: Created `tools/serve-logs.scm` to easily gather logs and serve them via HTTP for remote debugging. Added unit tests in `tools/test-serve-logs.scm`.
5. ✅ **Build Failure Diagnostics (2026-01-01)**: Added `DiagnoseBuildFailure` (dmesg, free, herd status) to `lib/common.go` to capture critical debug info on build failures.

**Superseded:**
- ❌ **Framework-dual Kernel Args Restore (2025-12-31)**: Restored `nomodeset`, `noapic`, `nolapic` after a refactor dropped them. **Reversed on 2026-08-01** — the refactor had been closer to correct. Those arguments were a misdiagnosis, not a hardware workaround. See item 1 above.

**See [archive/CHECKLIST_COMPLETED.md](archive/CHECKLIST_COMPLETED.md) for full history.**

## 🔄 Currently Working On

**Primary Focus: Cloudzy Installation Testing**

### Cloudzy Installation Testing (CURRENT PRIORITY)
**Focus**: Verify kernel symlink fix and recovery tool work correctly

**Recent Fixes:**
- ✅ **3-step kernel/initrd workaround implemented for Cloudzy (2025-12-17)**: Kernel tracking logs confirmed that `guix system init` (free-software-only) does NOT create kernel/initrd files - system generation only contains `['gnu','gnu.go','guix']`. Re-introduced 3-step workaround (build → copy → init) for Cloudzy, same as framework-dual.
- ✅ **Kernel tracking parity implemented (2025-12-17)**: Framework-dual now has comprehensive kernel tracking instrumentation matching cloudzy. See [docs/KERNEL_TRACKING.md](docs/KERNEL_TRACKING.md) for details.
- ✅ Kernel/initrd copying now uses `cp -L` to dereference symlinks
- ✅ Recovery tool rewritten in Go to share code with installer
- ✅ Network/DNS troubleshooting documented

**Next Steps:**
1. 🧪 **Test kernel symlink fix on Cloudzy VPS**
   - Run installer on fresh Cloudzy instance
   - Verify kernel files are copied correctly (should be 5-15 MB, not a few bytes)
   - Verify system boots successfully after installation
   - Check `/tmp/kernel_tracking.log` for kernel file journey traces (see [docs/KERNEL_TRACKING.md](docs/KERNEL_TRACKING.md) for how to analyze logs)

2. 🧪 **Test Go recovery tool**
   - Trigger recovery scenario (interrupt installer or simulate failure)
   - Verify recovery tool builds correctly during installation
   - Test recovery tool functionality (mount verification, system init, password setting)
   - Verify automatic retry logic works (up to 3 attempts)

3. 🧪 **Test network configuration**
   - Verify NetworkManager starts correctly after installation
   - Test DNS resolution (`ping ci.guix.gnu.org`)
   - Test `guix install` commands work after network is configured
   - Run `diagnose-guix-build.sh` to verify all checks pass

**Status**: Ready for testing - 3-step workaround implemented for Cloudzy, all fixes documented

**Key Discovery (2025-12-17):**
- Kernel tracking logs showed `guix system init` succeeds but system generation only contains `['gnu','gnu.go','guix']` - no kernel/initrd files
- This confirms the bug affects BOTH free-software-only (Cloudzy) and nonguix (Framework) installations
- Solution: Use 3-step workaround for all platforms (build system → manually copy kernel/initrd → install bootloader)

### Front 1: Framework-dual (Testing & Development)
**Focus**: Real-world installation testing, GNOME configuration, troubleshooting

**Status**: See "Framework-dual postinstall (IN TESTING)" section below

### Front 2: Cloudzy (Guile Conversion & Testing)
**Focus**: Complete conversion to `.scm` scripts and comprehensive testing

**Guile Conversion Project (IN PROGRESS):**

See [docs/GUILE_CONVERSION.md](docs/GUILE_CONVERSION.md) for comprehensive plan.

- ✅ Phase 1: Library infrastructure complete → [See archive](archive/CHECKLIST_COMPLETED.md#guile-conversion-project---phase-1-2025-11-15)
- ✅ Phase 2: Update postinstall scripts to use Guile helper → [See archive](archive/CHECKLIST_COMPLETED.md#guile-conversion-project---phase-2-2025-11-15)
- ✅ Phase 3: All scripts converted (20 total) → See "Batch Conversion System" section below
- ✅ **Phase 4: Cloudzy Deployment** (IN PROGRESS - 2025-12-18)
  - ✅ Deployed `postinstall/lib.scm` (converted from `postinstall/lib.sh`)
  - ✅ Deployed all recipe scripts to `postinstall/recipes/add/` (development, fonts, spacemacs, doom-emacs, vanilla-emacs)
  - ✅ Converted `cloudzy/postinstall/customize` to `cloudzy/postinstall/customize.scm`
  - ✅ Updated `lib/common.go` to download `.scm` version for cloudzy platform
  - ⏳ **Remaining**: Test converted scripts on actual Cloudzy VPS installation
  - ⏳ **Remaining**: Remove original `.sh` files after successful testing
  - **Goal**: Complete Guile conversion for cloudzy platform

- ✅ Batch Conversion Tools (COMPLETED) → [See archive](archive/CHECKLIST_COMPLETED.md#batch-conversion-tools-improvements-2025-11-15)

**Testing Strategy:**

- ✅ **Guile (.scm) scripts**: Fully tested in Docker + run-tests.sh → [See archive](archive/CHECKLIST_COMPLETED.md#testing-infrastructure-2025-11-15)
- ⏸️ **Shell (.sh) scripts**: Not actively testing, will migrate to Guile

**Framework-dual postinstall (IN TESTING):**

- ✅ All fixes complete → [See archive](archive/CHECKLIST_COMPLETED.md#framework-dual-postinstall-improvements-2025-11-15)
- ✅ Bootstrap script fixes → [See archive](archive/CHECKLIST_COMPLETED.md#recent-bootstrap--path-resolution-fixes-2025-11-15)
- ✅ GNOME launches successfully - display manager working
- ✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: GDM login loop is AMD GPU firmware issue, not authentication problem
  - TTY login works perfectly
  - GDM accepts password but drops back to login because GNOME session fails to start
  - `dmesg` shows: `Direct firmware load for amdgpu/psp_14_0_4_toc.bin failed with error -2`
  - ~~Issue: Current guix/nonguix master commits don't provide working AMD firmware for Framework 13 AMD~~
  - **Corrected 2026-08-01**: the diagnosis was backwards. `psp_14_0_4` is the
    **Strix Point** PSP. This laptop is a Framework 13 **Ryzen AI 300**
    (`1002:1114`, gfx11.5), which shipped July 2024. Its firmware entered
    linux-firmware mid-2024 and gfx11.5 entered Linux 6.10. Recent master has
    the firmware; it was the *old* pin that lacked it.
- ❌ **FIX WAS WRONG**: Wingo-era channel pinning (2024-02-16)
  - Guix commit: `91d80460296e2d5a01704d0f34fb966a45a165ae`
  - NonGuix commit: `10318ef7dd53c946bae9ed63f7e0e8bb8941b6b1`
  - Those commits predate the hardware by ~5 months, so the pin **guaranteed**
    the `psp_14_0_4_toc.bin ... error -2` failure it was adopted to fix.
    Pinning backwards cannot supply firmware for hardware that did not exist.
  - Wingo's post is about the earlier **Ryzen 7040** Framework 13. The pin was
    valid there and was transferred without re-validating against this machine.
  - `framework-dual/wingolog-channels.scm` is retained for Ryzen 7040 only, with
    a warning header.
- ✅ **REPINNED (2026-08-01)**: recent commits, still pinned for reproducibility
  - Constants `FrameworkDualGuixCommit` / `FrameworkDualNonguixCommit` /
    `FrameworkDualPinDate` in `lib/common.go`
  - guix `df2d121208127ac22f10e0f7c2f38d6c74e106a3` (confirmed identical on
    Savannah and Codeberg), nonguix `73baab37361b3a81f326aa3fdec78840f5acc577`
  - At that pin `(kernel linux)` = `linux-7.1`, `linux-lts` = `linux-6.18`;
    both comfortably exceed the >= 6.10 requirement
  - Policy rewritten in `docs/CHANNEL_PINNING_POLICY.md`: pinning is for
    reproducibility, and the pin must always be **newer** than the hardware
- ⏳ **NOT YET TESTED ON HARDWARE**: needs a reinstall or reconfigure to confirm
  amdgpu binds and GDM accepts input
  - ✅ **ISO artifacts cleanup complete** → [See archive](archive/CHECKLIST_COMPLETED.md#iso-artifacts-cleanup-implementation-2025-11-20)
    - **Problem**: When copying `/var/guix` from ISO using rsync/cp, ISO's filesystem structure was copied
    - **Solution**: Added `CleanupISOArtifacts()` function to fix filesystem invariants after ISO copy
    - **Implementation**: Fixes `/var/run` → `/run` symlink, `/etc/mtab` symlink, removes ISO artifacts
    - **Integration**: Added to all mount steps (cloudzy, framework, framework-dual)
    - **Recovery scripts**:
      - `lib/fix-iso-artifacts.sh` - Quick symlink fixes
      - `lib/recover-filesystem-invariants.sh` - Complete recovery with system rebuild
    - **Status**: ✅ Complete - future installs automatically fix these issues
  - ✅ **D-Bus activation failure fixed** → Root cause was ISO artifacts copying `/var/run` as directory
    - **Status**: ✅ Fixed by ensuring `/var/run` is correct symlink before system init
    - **For existing installations**: Use `lib/recover-filesystem-invariants.sh` for complete recovery

**System Recovery Status (2025-11-23):**

### 🔄 **Fresh Start Approach - Clean Install Testing**

**Previous Recovery Attempts:**
- Original Problem: Guix install was built by rsync'ing the live ISO, causing deep structural issues:
  - `/run` was copied as a real directory instead of tmpfs
  - `/var/run` was copied as a directory instead of symlink
  - Stale ISO sockets and runtime files in `/mnt/run`
  - ISO artifacts in `/etc/machine-id`, `/etc/mtab`, `/var/guix`
  - Activation scripts copied from ISO and out of sync
  - Result: PAM failed, sudo failed, reconfigure failed, dbus complained, system didn't boot cleanly

**Recovery Lessons Learned:**
- ✅ `/run` can be correctly mounted as tmpfs (fixes ISO leftovers)
- ✅ `sudo -v` can work (confirms PAM, dbus, elogind, session services are healthy)
- ✅ ISO artifacts can be removed (`/etc/mtab`, `/etc/machine-id`, `/etc/resolv.conf`, `/var/guix` ownership, `/run` stale contents)
- ⚠️ **Could not prevent `/var/run` from returning as a directory**: Current Guix intentionally recreates `/var/run` as a directory during early boot cleanup phase. This is **normal and correct** for this version (symlink approach coming in future patch upstream), but caused issues with wingolog time-machine reconfigure

**Current Status: Boot Hang Diagnosis (Framework-Dual)**
- ✅ **Clean Install Completed**: Filesystem created successfully.
- 🚧 **Boot Hang**: System hangs on startup (suspected AMD GPU firmware/GDM issue).
- ✅ **Environment Fixes**: Solved `curl` SSL errors by correcting system clock (ISO defaults to 2025, real year is 2026).
- 🧪 **Next Step**: Chroot into system, check `/var/log/messages` for firmware errors, and apply "Wingo" channel fix (`guix time-machine`).

**Action Plan for Fresh Install Test:**

1. **Boot the Guix ISO**
2. **Run install script on empty GUIX_ROOT partition**
3. **Verify clean install creates correct filesystem structure:**
   - `/run` should be tmpfs (not a directory)
   - `/var/run` behavior should be correct from the start
   - No ISO artifacts should be present
   - System should boot cleanly
4. **Test wingolog time-machine reconfigure on clean install:**
   - Verify if `/var/run/dbus` directory issue still occurs
   - If needed, apply DNS and PATH fixes in chroot (see notes below)
5. **Document results** - Compare clean install behavior vs recovered rsync install

**Notes for Future Reference (if chroot fixes needed):**

**DNS Fix for Chroot:**
- Before entering chroot (on ISO shell):
  ```sh
  rm -f /mnt/etc/resolv.conf
  cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf
  ```

**PATH Fix Inside Chroot:**
- After chrooting:
  ```sh
  SYSTEM=$(readlink -f /var/guix/profiles/system)
  export PATH="$SYSTEM/profile/bin:/run/setuid-programs:$PATH"
  hash -r
  ```

**Status:** Starting fresh with clean install test. Previous partition contents saved to external drive for reference.

**Bootstrap Command for Testing:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/durantschoon/cloudzy-guix-install/main/lib/bootstrap-postinstall.scm | guile
cd ~/guix-customize
./customize
# Select option 2 (Add desktop), then option 1 (GNOME)
```

**What's Ready:**

- GNOME installation uses Guile S-expression parser (no more sed!)
- NetworkManager, SSH, and desktop services all use guile_add_service()
- Full checksum verification via SOURCE_MANIFEST.txt
- Platform auto-detection (framework-dual)
- All Guile tests passing in Docker
- Bootstrap script fixed (syntax errors, path resolution, Go detection)
- Hash-to-words conversion requires Go (fatal error if missing)
- Customize scripts properly resolve paths (symlink support, INSTALL_ROOT)
- postinstall/lib.sh functions correctly use INSTALL_ROOT
- Batch conversion tools ready for production use

*(For detailed completion history, see [archive/CHECKLIST_COMPLETED.md](archive/CHECKLIST_COMPLETED.md))*

**Note:** Framework-dual postinstall testing should focus on GNOME configuration workflow. See [docs/POSTINSTALL_DEV.md](docs/POSTINSTALL_DEV.md) for testing and development instructions.

**Testing cloudzy installer with latest improvements:**

- ✅ **Kernel symlink fix implemented (2025-12-16)**: Fixed critical issue where kernel/initrd copying failed because files are symlinks
  - **Discovery**: Runtime investigation revealed kernel/initrd in system generation are symlinks pointing to other store paths
  - **Fix**: Updated all `cp` commands to use `-L` flag (dereference symlinks) in both Go code and bash recovery script
  - **Status**: Fix applied to `lib/common.go` and `lib/recovery-complete-install.sh`, documented in `INSTALLATION_KNOWLEDGE.md`
  - **Next steps**: Test on cloudzy VPS to verify kernel files are now copied correctly (should be 5-15 MB, not a few bytes)
- ✅ **Recovery tool rewritten in Go (2025-12-16)**: Complete rewrite eliminates sync issues between recovery and installer
  - **Implementation**: Created `cmd/recovery/main.go` that reuses functions from `lib/common.go`
  - **Benefits**: Single source of truth, automatic sync, consistent behavior
  - **Status**: Implemented and documented, falls back to bash script if Go build fails
  - **Next steps**: Test recovery tool on actual installation failures to verify it works correctly
- ✅ **Network/DNS troubleshooting documented (2025-12-16)**: Comprehensive troubleshooting guide added
  - **Documentation**: Added section to `INSTALLATION_KNOWLEDGE.md` covering DNS failures, network interface issues, firewall problems
  - **Tools**: Documents `diagnose-guix-build.sh` and `lib/fix-network.scm` scripts (Guile)
  - **Status**: Complete, ready for users encountering network issues
- 🧪 **Proactive fixes implemented (2025-12-16)**: Implemented proactive approach to prevent kernel/initrd issues
  - **Proactive symlink creation**: After `guix system init` completes, check if `/mnt/run/current-system` symlink exists. If missing, find latest system generation in `/gnu/store` and create symlink immediately
  - **Proactive kernel/initrd copying**: Right after ensuring symlink exists, immediately check if kernel/initrd exist in `/mnt/boot/`. If missing, copy them proactively from system generation (which we know exists)
  - **Benefits**: Avoids multiple recovery retry attempts, more efficient, cleaner approach
  - **Status**: Implemented in `lib/common.go:RunGuixSystemInitFreeSoftware()`, ready for testing
  - **Next steps**: Test on cloudzy VPS to verify proactive fixes prevent kernel/initrd issues
- ✅ **Recovery script kernel/initrd verification improvements (2025-12-16)**: Added comprehensive verification for framework-dual
  - **Issue**: Recovery script reported "bootloader installed successfully" even when kernel files were missing
  - **Fix**: Verify kernel/initrd exist in system generation BEFORE copying, verify files copied successfully, verify before Step 3 bootloader install
  - **Behavior**: Fails early with clear error messages if kernel files missing, prevents false success messages
  - **Status**: Implemented in `lib/recovery-complete-install.sh`, better error messages for AMD GPU/nonguix issues
- ✅ **Auto-recovery from hung processes (2025-12-16)**: Added automatic process termination after 10 consecutive "hung" warnings
  - **Issue**: Installer could hang indefinitely on cloudzy VPS during `guix system init` phase
  - **Fix**: `RunCommandWithSpinner` now detects hung processes (no output + log not growing for 15+ minutes) and automatically stops after 10 warnings
  - **Behavior**: Kills hung process and suggests running recovery script
  - **Status**: Implemented in `lib/common.go`, prevents indefinite hangs
- ✅ **Recovery script automatic kernel/initrd recovery (2025-12-16)**: Added recovery logic for missing kernel/initrd after `guix system init`
  - **Issue**: `guix system init` reports success but kernel/initrd files are missing (especially on free software installs)
  - **Fix**: Recovery script now attempts to copy kernel/initrd from system generation if missing after init
  - **Behavior**: Finds system generation, copies kernel/initrd, creates symlink, verifies files exist
  - **Status**: Implemented in `lib/recovery-complete-install.sh`, handles both time-machine and free software paths
- ✅ **Recovery script exit trap verification (2025-12-16)**: Added EXIT trap to ensure verification always runs
  - **Issue**: If recovery script exits early (error, interrupt), verification might not run
  - **Fix**: EXIT trap runs verification function regardless of exit method
  - **Behavior**: Checks kernel/initrd, runs comprehensive verification script, offers automatic rerun if fails
  - **Status**: Implemented with proper loop prevention flags
- ✅ **Initrd configuration fix (2025-11-17)**: Removed explicit `base-initrd` specification for cloudzy
  - **Issue**: `base-initrd` doesn't accept `#:linux` and `#:linux-modules` keyword arguments that Guix passes when `(kernel linux-libre)` is specified
  - **Error**: `Invalid keyword: (#:linux ...)` during config validation
  - **Fix**: Omit initrd specification entirely for free software installations - Guix uses default initrd generation which automatically handles kernel and modules
  - **Documentation**: Updated `INSTALLATION_KNOWLEDGE.md` to clarify when to use explicit initrd vs defaults
  - **Status**: Fixed in `cloudzy/install/03-config.go`, ready for testing
- ✅ 3-step kernel/initrd fix applied and tested
- ✅ Color-coded output with cycling headers
- ✅ Enhanced manifest verification with Quick checksum view
- ✅ Improved swap creation error messages
- ✅ Daemon startup timeout increased to 2 minutes
- ✅ Graceful validation skip if daemon not responsive
- ✅ Robust daemon startup: functional approach that ensures daemon is actually ready (restarts until responsive, not just retries)
- ✅ Post-install steps made resilient: password setting always attempted, verification non-fatal
- ✅ Better error handling: clear messages when post-install steps incomplete, suggests recovery script
- ✅ Comprehensive verification at end: runs full verify-guix-install.sh script, ensures EFI mounted, prevents reboot if verification fails
- ✅ Framework-dual kernel fixes applied to cloudzy: checks broken symlink, automatic fallback copy of kernel/initrd if missing
- ✅ Verification after guix system init: checks for kernel/initrd files and broken symlink, retries with manual copy if needed
- ✅ VERBOSE=1 instructions added everywhere verify script is mentioned (helps debug file detection issues)

**Oracle Cloud Free Tier Support (In Progress, 2026-07-31):**

- ⏳ **Goal**: Run Guix System on Oracle Cloud Free Tier
- **Why**: Oracle Cloud Free Tier offers ARM64 and x86_64 instances with generous free tier limits, expanding platform support

- 🚩 **Blocking finding**: **OCI cannot boot an ISO.** Importing an ISO is not
  supported; OCI accepts only QCOW2/VMDK custom images uploaded to Object
  Storage. Every platform in this repo — cloudzy included — is built on "boot
  the Guix live ISO → partition → mount → `guix system init`", so that model
  does not transfer. Oracle is an **image-build** platform, not an ISO-boot
  platform, and is therefore not a `cp -r cloudzy oracle` job.

- **Approach adopted**: build locally with `guix system image -t qcow2
  --image-size=50G` → upload to Object Storage → import as custom image
  (launch mode `PARAVIRTUALIZED`) → launch `VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro`.

- ✅ `oci` CLI installed and authenticating (home region `us-ashburn-1`)
- ✅ `oracle/image/oracle-image.scm` written — headless, SSH-key-only,
  serial console on `ttyS0`, swap file service for the 1 GiB shape
- ✅ Validated: `guix system image ... --dry-run` evaluates cleanly and
  computes a full derivation
- ✅ `oracle/image/oracle-image_purpose.txt` documents every setting and the
  deliberate omissions (no `initrd-modules`, root label must stay
  `Guix_image`, swap as a shepherd service rather than `swap-devices`)
- ⏳ Not yet booted — untested in QEMU and on OCI
- 🚩 **Blocked: the image will not build locally.** Three attempts, identical
  failure, and it is NOT in `oracle-image.scm` — the config evaluates fine and
  the build gets as far as populating the image's root:

  ```
  gnu/build/image.scm:265   register-closure "tmp-root" "system"
  guix/store/database.scm:102  call-with-database "tmp-root/var/guix/db/db.sqlite"
  sqlite3.scm:166: sqlite-error (sqlite-exec 5 "database is locked")
  ```

  Ruled out: concurrent QEMU disk I/O (failed again after that VM exited), a
  running `guix gc` (none), and host store db contention (`/var/guix/db/db.sqlite`
  idle). Attempts 1–2 copied all 350 store items first; attempt 3 threw almost
  immediately, so it is not a timeout under load.

  **Leading hypothesis (unproven): the host root filesystem is full.** SQLite
  reports "database is locked" rather than a disk error when it cannot create
  its rollback journal, and `/` on this laptop is a 58.6 G partition sitting at
  ~97% with ~2 G free — not enough for a 50 G image plus its temporary root.

  ⏸️ **Paused 2026-08-02 pending more disk space.** Resume by freeing space
  (`guix gc -F 20G` reclaims ~2425 dead items, but coordinate first: the
  framework-dual work boots system paths out of this same store), then:

  ```sh
  # A pty is REQUIRED -- redirecting to a file makes the progress reporter die
  # with "terminal-window-size: Inappropriate ioctl for device" before the
  # build even starts. This is what invalidated the earlier time-machine test.
  script -qec 'guix system image -t qcow2 --image-size=50G \
      oracle/image/oracle-image.scm' /dev/null
  ```

  If it fails again with real headroom, the disk theory is dead. Fall back to:
  `--cores=1 --max-jobs=1`; `guix pull` (this Guix is 134 days old and this
  smells like a fixed upstream bug — an unpinned-master channels file for that
  test was drafted but never run); check whether `guix-daemon --discover=yes`
  is implicated; search guix-devel for "register-closure database is locked".
- ⏳ Upload / import / launch commands drafted in `oracle/README.md` but unrun
- ⏳ Open question: boot volume may appear as `/dev/sda` rather than
  `/dev/vda`, which would break the first `guix system reconfigure`

- **Superseded analysis** — the Top 5 below was written assuming the cloudzy
  ISO installer could be adapted. Kept for reference, but items 1–2 and 5
  (device detection, boot mode, partitioning) are now handled declaratively by
  the image definition rather than by runtime detection. Items 3–4 (network
  interface naming, serial console) remain relevant.
- **Top 5 Things Needed to Update Cloudzy Scripts:**

  1. **Device Detection Updates** (`cloudzy/install/01-partition.go`):
     - Oracle Cloud may use different device naming (e.g., `/dev/sda` vs `/dev/vda`)
     - May need to detect device type (NVMe, SCSI, VirtIO) and handle accordingly
     - Oracle Cloud Free Tier ARM64 instances might use different storage controllers

  2. **Boot Mode Detection** (`cloudzy/install/01-partition.go`, `lib/common.go`):
     - Oracle Cloud Free Tier typically uses UEFI, but detection might differ
     - May need to handle Oracle Cloud's specific EFI partition requirements
     - Verify EFI partition detection works correctly in Oracle Cloud environment

  3. **Network Configuration** (`cloudzy/install/03-config.go`, `postinstall/customize`):
     - Oracle Cloud uses different network interface naming (may be `ens3` instead of `eth0`)
     - May need Oracle Cloud-specific network service configuration
     - Consider Oracle Cloud's cloud-init integration (if applicable)

  4. **Console/Serial Access** (`lib/bootstrap-installer.sh`):
     - Oracle Cloud uses web-based console access (different from Cloudzy's VNC/KVM)
     - May need to handle serial console differently
     - Font selection and display might need adjustments for Oracle Cloud console

  5. **Storage and Partitioning** (`cloudzy/install/01-partition.go`):
     - Oracle Cloud Free Tier has specific storage limits and configurations
     - May need to handle Oracle Cloud's block volume attachments differently
     - Consider Oracle Cloud's boot volume vs block volume distinction
     - Verify partitioning works with Oracle Cloud's storage backend

**Framework 13 Post-Install Process (2025-11-10):**

Learned the complete workflow for getting Framework 13 fully operational after minimal install:

1. **First Boot State:**
   - Wired ethernet works (dhclient running)
   - WiFi/Bluetooth NOT working (missing firmware)
   - No NetworkManager (can't easily switch to WiFi)
   - Guix 1.4.0 from ISO (old, doesn't support channel introductions)

2. **Post-Install Steps Required:**

   ```bash
   # Step 1: First guix pull (upgrade Guix to support channel introductions)
   guix pull
   # Takes 10-30 min, upgrades to latest Guix from master

   # Step 2: Create channels.scm with nonguix
   mkdir -p ~/.config/guix
   cat > ~/.config/guix/channels.scm <<'EOF'
   (cons* (channel
           (name 'nonguix)
           (url "https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix")
           (branch "master")
           (introduction
            (make-channel-introduction
             "897c1a470da759236cc11798f4e0a5f7d4d59fbc"
             (openpgp-fingerprint
              "2A39 3FFF 68F4 EF7A 3D29  12AF 6F51 20A0 22FB B2D5"))))
          %default-channels)
   EOF

   # Step 3: Second guix pull (add nonguix channel)
   guix pull
   # Takes 10-30 min, fetches nonguix

   # Step 4: Fix PATH to use pulled Guix
   export PATH="$HOME/.config/guix/current/bin:$PATH"
   # Add to ~/.bashrc for persistence

   # Step 5: Verify nonguix is available
   guix describe  # Should show both guix and nonguix
   guix show linux  # Should find non-free kernel
   guix show linux-firmware  # Should find proprietary firmware

   # Step 6: Add NetworkManager to /etc/config.scm
   sudo nano /etc/config.scm
   # Add (service network-manager-service-type) to services

   # Step 7: Reconfigure system
   sudo guix system reconfigure /etc/config.scm
   # Takes 5-15 min, installs NetworkManager

   # Step 8: Connect to WiFi
   nmcli device wifi list
   nmcli device wifi connect "SSID" --ask

   # Step 9: Run customize script
   ~/guix-customize/customize
   # Add desktop, packages, etc.
   ```

3. **Common Pitfalls:**
   - **PATH issue:** `guix describe` shows old Guix if PATH not updated
   - **Generation mismatch:** Pulled Guix is generation 2, system uses generation 1
   - **Channel introduction required:** Old Guix 1.4.0 can't authenticate nonguix without upgrade
   - **Two-step pull required:** Can't add nonguix until after first pull upgrades Guix

4. **Automation Opportunities:**
   - Post-install script could automate the two-pull process
   - Could pre-populate ~/.bashrc with correct PATH
   - Could check for and fix PATH issues automatically
   - Customize script should detect missing NetworkManager and offer to add it

## 📋 Remaining Work

### 🟡 Medium Priority

#### 1. Add NetworkManager to Framework Customize Script

**Status:** ❌ Missing from customize script

**Current gap:** Framework 13 first boot has no persistent networking. User must manually add NetworkManager service to config.scm before running customize script.

**Proposed solution:**

- Add NetworkManager as high-priority option (option 0 or automatic)
- Include in Framework-specific hardware setup
- Document in first-boot instructions

**Impact:** ⭐⭐⭐ High - Critical for laptop usability

---

#### 2. Dual-Boot GRUB UX Improvements

**Status:** ❌ Not implemented

Ensure readable GRUB theme and visible timeout; add explicit chainloader entry for Pop!_OS in EFI if auto-detection fails.

**Current state:**

- ✅ Timeout set to 5 seconds
- ✅ os-prober configured in recovery script
- ❌ Need to test chainloader detection
- ❌ GRUB theme not customized

**Impact:** ⭐⭐ Medium - Smoother dual-boot selection

---

#### 2a. Generalize Dual-Boot Documentation and Configuration

**Status:** ❌ Not implemented

Make the dual-boot section more generic and helpful for users dual-booting with other OSes (not just Pop!_OS), and enable easy high-level configuration.

**Goals:**

- Generalize `docs/GUIDE_DUAL_BOOT.md` to work with any Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc.), not just Pop!_OS
- Make installer scripts configurable at a high level for different dual-boot scenarios
- Document common dual-boot patterns (systemd-boot, GRUB, Windows, etc.)
- Enable contributions from others who modify scripts for their own dual-boot setups
- Provide clear extension points for customizing bootloader detection and configuration

**Current limitations:**

- Documentation assumes Pop!_OS (systemd-boot) as the existing OS
- Installer scripts have Pop!_OS-specific detection logic
- GRUB configuration assumes Pop!_OS chainloading pattern
- Limited guidance for other bootloader types (GRUB, Windows Boot Manager, etc.)

**Proposed approach:**

- Extract Pop!_OS-specific logic into configurable parameters
- Document bootloader detection patterns for common distributions
- Create extension guide for contributors adapting scripts to other OSes
- Add high-level configuration options (bootloader type, detection method, etc.)
- Include examples for common dual-boot scenarios (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, Windows)

**Impact:** ⭐⭐⭐ High - Makes dual-boot installer useful for broader audience, enables community contributions

---

#### 3. Bootloader Timeout Configuration

**Status:** ⚠️ Partially implemented

**Current:**

```scheme
(bootloader-configuration
  (bootloader grub-efi-bootloader)
  (targets '("/boot/efi"))
  (timeout 5))  ; Already set in framework-dual
```

**Need to verify:**

- Framework single-boot installer also has timeout
- Cloudzy installer has appropriate timeout
- Timeout is documented in generated configs

**Impact:** ⭐⭐ Medium - Affects dual-boot usability

---

#### 4. Storage Options Documentation

**Status:** ❌ Not documented

Provide documented flows for:

- LUKS + ext4 root
- btrfs with subvolumes and periodic scrub hooks
- Flag to reserve N GiB unallocated and/or create separate `/home`

**Impact:** ⭐⭐ Medium - Security/flexibility options for advanced users

---

#### 5. Safer Retries and Diagnostics

**Status:** ❌ Not implemented

Toggle verbose vs quiet logging; capture `guix describe` and `guix weather` summaries into the log and receipt.

**Impact:** ⭐⭐ Medium - Easier troubleshooting

---

#### 6. Post-Install Customization Profiles

**Status:** ❌ Not implemented

Split `/etc/config.scm` into base OS vs hardware profile; provide a "first reconfigure" profile that adds firmware, NetworkManager, SSH, time sync, and trim in one step.

**Impact:** ⭐⭐ Medium - Faster, cleaner onboarding

---

### 🟢 Low Priority (Nice to Have)

#### 7. Label Verification Output

**Status:** ❌ Not shown to user

Should display:

```bash
# Show labels after formatting
echo "Verifying partition labels..."
e2label /dev/nvme0n1p2        # Should show: GUIX_ROOT
fatlabel /dev/nvme0n1p1       # Should show: EFI
parted /dev/nvme0n1 print     # Should show GPT names
```

**Impact:** ⭐ Low - Nice for debugging

---

#### 8. Stronger Installation Receipts

**Status:** ⚠️ Partially implemented

**Current:**

- ✅ Basic receipt written
- ✅ Channel commits included (via recovery script)
- ❌ Need `/run/current-system` derivation
- ❌ Need complete substitute server list
- ❌ Need authorization keys list

**Impact:** ⭐ Low - Better provenance tracking

---

#### 9. Raspberry Pi Track Enhancements

**Status:** ❌ Not implemented

Add optional image build recipe and Pi-specific initrd modules/services (chrony, headless SSH with key drop).

**Impact:** ⭐ Low - Broader hardware support

---

#### 10. Labels vs Device Paths Explanation

**Status:** ❌ Not documented

Add a one-sentence explanation and simple diagram where labels first appear in documentation.

**Impact:** ⭐ Low - Easier mental model for new users

---

#### 11. Optional Channel Pinning Toggle Documentation

**Status:** ❌ Not documented

Provide a short on/off toggle doc section; default remains safe/unpinned.

**Impact:** ⭐ Low - Simpler onboarding choice

---

#### 12. Swap Partition Support

**Status:** ⚠️ Only swapfile support

**Current:** Only supports creating swapfile in step 4

**Could add:** Detection and use of existing swap partition

**Impact:** ⭐ Low - Swapfile works fine for most users

---

#### 13. Reserved Disk Space Option

**Status:** ❌ Not implemented

**Could add:**

- Allow leaving 10-20GB unallocated
- User configurable via env var

**Impact:** ⭐ Low - Most users don't need this

---

#### 14. Script Directory Reorganization

**Status:** ✅ Complete (v1.1.0)

**Completed:**

- ✅ Moved critical scripts to `lib/` subdirectory:
  - `lib/verify-guix-install.sh`
  - `lib/recovery-complete-install.sh`
  - `lib/bootstrap-installer.sh`
  - `lib/postinstall.sh` (already in lib/)
- ✅ Kept development/repo scripts at top level:
  - `update-manifest.sh`
  - `run-tests.sh`
- ✅ Updated bootstrap script internal paths
- ✅ Updated SOURCE_MANIFEST.txt with new paths
- ✅ Updated documentation references:
  - README.md
  - QUICKSTART.md
  - docs/INSTALLATION_KNOWLEDGE.md
  - postinstall/CHANNEL_MANAGEMENT.md
- ✅ All tests pass after reorganization

**Breaking changes (v1.1.0):**

- GitHub download URLs changed to use `lib/bootstrap-installer.sh`
- Users should update their bookmarks/documentation

**Benefits achieved:**

- Clear separation between Guix runtime scripts and development scripts
- Consistent with `lib/common.go` pattern
- Easier to understand repository structure

**Impact:** ⭐ Low - Better organization with minimal disruption

## 🎯 Core Design Principles

These principles guide all implementation work:

### 1. Super-Minimal Initial config.scm

- Keep only: host-name, locale, timezone, bootloader, file-systems, users
- No desktop environment, SSH, or optional services in initial install
- Goal: Reliably install a bootable Guix system shell

### 2. Verify Before Reboot

- Check kernel and initrd exist in `/mnt/boot/`
- Verify GRUB EFI files exist
- Refuse to reboot if critical files missing

### 3. Pre-Set User Password

- After `guix system init` but before reboot
- Use `chroot` and `passwd` command
- Avoids storing secrets in version control

### 4. Hardware-Aware Defaults

- Framework-specific: include AMD GPU, NVMe, USB modules in initrd
- Include linux-firmware via nonguix for real-world hardware
- Set stable kernel arguments
